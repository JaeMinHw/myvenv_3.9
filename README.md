## ssvep eeg data

---

In order to accumulate brain wave data, learning data must be created.
Although ssvep data at 5-second intervals is required, manually creating the data takes a lot of time and requires two or more people, including testers. To reduce hassle, a random frequency is selected and notified to the tester through voice. Clicking the button once measures 10 random frequencies.
